Isn't it crazy that we live in a time right now where intelligent people have to stay silent so that stupid people don't get offended? Uh people used to get burned alive for offending the beliefs of stupid people. When was this golden age when there were no consequences for offending stupid people between the 14th and 18th century like 40 to 60,000 people almost entirely women were put to death because stupid people thought they were witches. Most of them were just like a little bit more independent and willful than usual, which stupid people found very frightening. In the 1600s, when Galileo presented evidence that the solar system was heliocentric, which means that the earth revolves around the sun, which of course it does, he was sentenced to life imprisonment because that contradicted the stupid dogmatic beliefs of stupid people in power who were worried that allowing facts to contradict their stupid beliefs might weaken their stupid power. Alan Touring who created a machine able to crack German code allowing the allies to track German movement which was quite possibly the single greatest contribution towards ending the second world war made by any single individual person and also laid the groundwork for modern computing. So it's also one of the single greatest contributions towards creating the modern world made by any single person. Well, in the 1950s, he was chemically castrated when found guilty of the crime of homosexuality, which disrupted his body chemistry so badly that he couldn't function and he couldn't work, which led to chronic depression and eventually led to suicide. He was only 41 years old, which for a scientist is still in his prime. So quite literally one of the greatest minds that humanity has ever produced was cut short in its prime because his sexual preferences were deemed offensive by stupid people. About the same time the civil rights movement was starting in the United States of America because you know black people were still not equal under the law. forbidden access to public services, to restrooms, to bus seats, but more importantly to things like quality education and meaningful opportunity. Preventing social mobility designed to keep people eternally as secondclass citizens in a country that they're forced enslaved labor quite literally built from the ground up. Now, preventing social mobility will increase poverty, which increases desperation, which statistically will increase the crime rate, particularly if combined with hyper scrutiny and brutal policing. That increased crime rate can then be held up as evidence to justify the hyper scrutiny, the brutal policing, and the inequality in the first place. All made possible by appealing to the beliefs of stupid people who believed they were special people and were offended by the notion that people were equal regardless of pigmentation. Now, obviously, this situation is still ongoing in a new and modern form. Now, I'm no expert on that, so I'm going to leave that conversation to people with more direct experience. But my point is, even the historical events are not that historical. This was less than a lifetime ago. The current king of England was alive when this was happening. The current president of the United States was alive when this was happening. Which kind of makes it worrying when he says he wants to make America great again? Because, you know, I know it's a cliche question, but when do you mean which era do you want to revive? Was it like when you were a little boy and black people weren't allowed to play basketball? Imagine how stupid you have to be to be offended by black people playing basketball. Was it great when you were a young adult when grown-up women weren't guaranteed the right to get a bank account in their own name without seeking permission from their father or their husband or a male guardian? That was in 1974 when that happened. Which means when Donald Trump was an 18-year-old legal adult, he could get a bank account in his own name without asking permission. But his actual grownup adult ass mother who raised him was not guaranteed that same right. Was it back in the 80s when like Thatcher and Reagan convinced all the stupid people that if we just give all the wealth to the wealthy people that will somehow make all the poor people rich. but you know actually triggered the rapid expansion of wealth inequality which today has gotten so bad that we're back to the same relative wealth gap that we had during like Marie Antoinet French Revolution level feudalism. Was it neoc colonialism installing and backing genocidal dictators all over the world? Was it the war on drugs or the war on terror? Exactly which era of greatness are you trying to recapture? Now, it occurs to me that having to tread lightly to avoid the rage of stupid people has kind of always just been a fact of human life. But it also occurs to me that the people who are being the loudest about how wokeism has gone too far and you can't say anything anymore and people are too easily offended are the same people advocating for like a legally enforced return to the traditional moral family values of the ideology that used to burn people alive for offending them. It also occurs to me that a lot of the people who are the loudest about how you can't share your opinions anymore without facing horrible dire consequences are actually like making a very very comfortable living sharing those very opinions. You know, getting rewarded and getting wealthy, saying the things you just can't say anymore. It kind of seems that what they're actually saying is it used to be easier for people like me. People like me used to be able to voice our opinion without any kind of social consequences. There's not quite as much special treatment for people like me anymore. And I and you know the people like me who follow me well we find that offensive.

## Title
RANT OF THE WEEK: Professional Sports Are A Cesspool !

## Description
At the NBA All-Star game on February 15, an Israeli reporter asked Lebron James about Israel. Lebron responded by claiming that he had heard ‘nothing but great things about Israel’.

In his latest Rant Of The Week, Dimitri Lascaris argues that Lebron’s lies about Israel are just one example of a much larger problem. The problem is that professional sports are a moral cesspool.
