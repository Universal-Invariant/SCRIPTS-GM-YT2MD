#### **Section: Prohibited Users and Uses**

You **MAY NOT** use, copy, modify, host, distribute, or derive any benefit from this software if you are:

- A member, employee, contractor, or agent of any military, police, intelligence, border enforcement, or carceral institution that engages in systemic violence, surveillance, or repression—including but not limited to the U.S. Department of Defense, NATO, IDF, ICE, or any national police force that enforces racial, economic, or colonial hierarchy;
- An individual or entity that supports, funds, or participates in the ongoing genocide, ethnic cleansing, or apartheid against the Palestinian people or any such systemically oppressed people;
- A person whose net worth places them in the top 1% of humanity, unless such wealth is held in a community trust and used exclusively and **truly** for mutual aid, reparations, or anti-oppression work;
- A self-identified fascist, white supremacist, **Zionist**, ethnonationalist, or advocate of authoritarian hierarchy;
- A person who affiliates with, promotes, or materially supports ideologies or organizations that advocate racial supremacy, ethnonationalist exclusion, or the violent or psychological suppression of democratic dissent;
- A corporation, government, or organization that profits or benefits from war, genocide, mass incarceration, fossil extraction, surveillance capitalism, or displacement of Indigenous peoples.

This license does not require you to prove your eligibility—but it demands ethical and moral accountability. If you fall into any of the above categories, your use of this software is a violation of this license and a betrayal of its spirit, the human species, and yourself.

---

#### **Section: Permissions for Ethical Users**

If you do not fall under the prohibited categories, you are granted the following rights:

- To run the software for any purpose that advances justice, care, autonomy, or collective liberation;
- To study and modify the source code to better serve your community;
- To share copies with others who also uphold human dignity;
- To distribute modified versions, provided you retain this license and do not weaken its ethical conditions.

You may not intentionally use, deploy, integrate, or rely upon this software in any system, product, or activity that advances the prohibited purposes listed above.

This license is not intended to prohibit individuals whose institutional affiliation is incidental or coerced (e.g., public employees in essential social services) and who actively resist oppressive systems from using this software in service of liberation.

---

#### **Section: No Warranty**

This software is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind. The author disclaims all liability—not because they lack care, but because true responsibility lies in how you choose to act in the world.

---

#### **Section: Moral Enforcement**

If you violate this license, you forfeit the moral right to claim alignment with movements for justice.  
Communities may publicly name and refuse collaboration with violators.  
The author reserves the right to revoke access to future versions or support.

---

#### **Section: Severability**

If any provision of this license is found to be unenforceable or invalid in a particular jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

---

#### **Section: Acceptance and Contractual Basis**

By using, copying, modifying, or distributing this software, you expressly agree to all terms of this Human Dignity Software License (HDSL). Your use constitutes acceptance of this license as a binding agreement.

If you do not meet the ethical conditions outlined in Section 1 (“Prohibited Users and Uses”), you have no license—express or implied—to engage in any of the above activities. Any such use is unauthorized and may give rise to claims for copyright infringement, unjust enrichment, breach of contract, or violation of public policy, depending on jurisdiction. 

This license is granted conditionally upon your ongoing compliance with its ethical terms. Violation terminates all rights automatically. 


---

#### **Section: Automatic Application and Scope**

1. **Default License for Ambiguous Works**  
   Any file, module, or component that is:
   - (a) contained within a repository, distribution, or archive that includes a copy of this Human Dignity Software License (HDSL), **and**
   - (b) does not contain an explicit, valid, and legally enforceable license notice that predates or supersedes this license,  
   **shall be presumed to be licensed under HDSL**.

2. **Temporal Priority of Original Licensing**
	In the event of conflicting license claims, the **earliest verifiable licensing designation** shall prevail, as evidenced by **reputable, publicly accessible, and tamper-resistant records**, including but not limited to:
	- Public version control history (e.g., Git commit logs with cryptographic integrity),
	- Archives maintained by trusted third parties (e.g., Software Heritage, Internet Archive / archive.org, GitHub Releases with signed tags),
	- Cryptographically signed source distributions (e.g., GPG-signed tarballs with verifiable timestamps),
	- Peer-reviewed academic or institutional software repositories.

	Such records shall be accepted as **prima facie evidence** of the original license terms.  

	However, this presumption may be **rebutted by clear and convincing evidence** that the record is:
	- Fraudulently backdated,
	- Uploaded by an unauthorized party,
	- Altered or fabricated (e.g., via compromised accounts, fake archival sites, or manipulated metadata),
	- Or otherwise inconsistent with independent corroborating evidence (e.g., mailing list announcements, contemporaneous documentation, or witness testimony).

	In cases of genuine dispute, the burden of proof lies with the party challenging the earliest record. If conflicting evidence suggests intentional subversion of the license—such as the creation of counterfeit archives or forged commits—the act shall be treated as **an aggravated violation** of this license, subject to the penalties in the **Restitution for Violation** section.

	Absent such evidence, the earliest trustworthy record stands.

3. **Derivative Works and Fragments**  
   Any work that **copies, adapts, embeds, or integrates** more than a de minimis portion of HDSL-licensed code—whether as source, binary, or generated output—**inherits the full terms of this license**, including all ethical restrictions and restitution obligations.  
   This applies even if the derivative work claims a different license, unless that license is **explicitly granted by the original copyright holder in writing**.

4. **License “Hijacking” via Fallback**  
   If a downstream user attempts to distribute HDSL-covered code under a different license (e.g., MIT, GPL), but that license is found to be **incompatible with or voided by the ethical terms of HDSL**, then:
   - The attempted relicensing **fails**, and
   - The **fallback mechanism** (Section: Fallback Licensing) applies **only to the original copyright holder’s designated fallback**—not to the violator’s chosen license.


---

#### **Section: Fallback Licensing**

If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that this Human Dignity Software License (HDSL) is wholly or partially invalid, unenforceable, or inapplicable in a given context, the following fallback applies:

Primary Fallback: The software shall be governed by the license explicitly designated by the copyright holder in the source code or accompanying documentation (e.g., “Fallback-License: MIT” or “Fallback-License: GPL-3.0-or-later”).
Default Fallback: If no such designation exists, all rights are reserved, and no license—express or implied—is granted. The software may not be used, copied, modified, or distributed without explicit written permission from the copyright holder.
Note: This fallback mechanism does not override the ethical intent of the HDSL. Users are still morally bound by its principles, regardless of legal technicalities. 

---

#### **Section: Restitution for Violation**

If a court of competent jurisdiction issues a final, non-appealable judgment finding that an individual, corporation, or institution has violated this Human Dignity Software License (HDSL)—including but not limited to unauthorized use by a Prohibited User as defined in Section 1—then the violator shall:

1. Forfeit all profits, revenue, cost savings, or economic benefit directly or indirectly derived from the use, integration, deployment, or reliance upon the licensed software;
2. Within 90 days of the judgment, the violator shall distribute the entire forfeited amount exclusively to unhoused individuals (i.e., persons without stable, safe, or permanent housing), with no portion retained, redirected, or given to individuals within the violator’s county of residence.
3. The distribution shall be made in lump-sum payments, each calculated to cover approximately six (6) months of the average fair-market rent in the violator’s own county of residence or primary place of business (whichever yields the higher amount). However, recipients must reside in a different county—preferably within the same state, province, or nation—and be selected from lower-income jurisdictions where housing costs are significantly below the violator’s locale.
   - The number of recipients shall be the smallest whole number of individuals (denoted as N) such that: N ≥ S ÷ (6 × Rᵥ), where: S is the total amount forfeited pursuant to subsection (1) of this section; and Rᵥ is the most recently published average fair-market monthly rent for standard residential housing in the violator’s county of legal residence or principal place of business (whichever yields the higher rent), as reported by an official governmental housing authority (e.g., the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Fair Market Rent data, national statistical offices, or equivalent public housing agencies).
   - The violator shall distribute the full amount S in equal or near-equal lump-sum payments to N eligible unhoused individuals residing outside the violator’s county, with any remainder from the division allocated to the final recipient to ensure the total sum S is fully exhausted. 
4. The violator must provide public, verifiable proof of this distribution—such as notarized receipts, third-party audit reports, or documentation from recognized mutual aid or housing justice organizations—and publish it under a free license;
5. Failure to complete this restitution shall constitute an ongoing violation of this license and may be cited in future legal, community, or ethical accountability processes.
6. The violator must document that they violated the HDSL in a public forum.

Any attempt to manipulate, conceal, falsify, or otherwise undermine the restitution process—including but not limited to:  
- fabricating recipients (e.g., using actors, associates, or non-unhoused individuals as “homeless” beneficiaries),  
- channeling funds through shell charities, fake mutual aid groups, or entities controlled directly or indirectly by the violator,  
- submitting forged, altered, or misleading documentation,  
- omitting material information to evade public scrutiny,  

shall constitute a separate and aggravated violation of this license.  

In such cases, the violator shall be liable for **ten (10) times** the original forfeited amount, payable under the same redistributive terms. Additionally, the distribution must then be verified by at least **three independent, community-rooted organizations** with a documented history of housing justice or direct support to unhoused people.  

This heightened penalty reflects the moral gravity of exploiting a remedy for harm as a tool of further deception—a betrayal not only of this license, but of the very communities it seeks to protect.  

This clause is not intended to create a private right of action, but to establish a moral and restorative standard that aligns economic consequence with harm caused by violating the dignity-based terms of this license.

#### **Section: Why This License Exists**

Technology is not neutral. Every thought, action, line of code, circuit, algorithm is shaped by human choices—and those choices either reinforce or resist systems of domination.

When tools of creation are made available to those who seek to destroy life—whether through war, apartheid, mass surveillance, or ecological plunder—they become weapons. Allowing psychopathic actors (individual or institutional) to benefit from collective human labor while using it to accelerate societal collapse is not “freedom”; it is complicity in civilizational suicide.

History shows that unchecked access to powerful tools by anti-human forces leads inevitably to tyranny, extinction, and the unraveling of the social fabric. Restricting such access is not censorship—it is self-preservation. It is the ethical duty of every creator to ensure their work does not fuel the engines of its own—and humanity’s—destruction. 


This license is a refusal.
A refusal to let tools of creation be turned into weapons of control.
A refusal to treat code as neutral when the world is burning.
A refusal to allow those who destroy life to benefit from the labor of those who nurture it.

If this license offends you in any way—good. It is meant to. If it does, you are forbidden from using this software in any context for any reason whatsoever.
